== Product Overview
Contact’em is a convenient and easy address book application, that allows you to both store and retrieve your contacts easily and quickly. This desktop application uses a command line interface, that is, most of the commands are entered through the keyboard.

The target audience of this application is anyone who requires an application to help keep track of the details of their contacts, especially those with extensive number of contacts and/or want to keep track of many details of their contacts in an organized manner.

Compared to other similar applications, Contact’em prides itself on its ease-of-use.

== About
This user guide is meant to walk users through the many different commands Contact’em can perform for the user, and gives a few examples for selected commands so users can better understand their usage.

While Contact’em is designed to be intuitive for all users, we suggest new users take a look at this guide so that they can better enjoy using this application.

A quick-reference guide is included near the end of this document (Section 9 - Page 41), for users to easily refer to the application commands.

== Using the Application

Below are the details of commands currently available and their usage.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing Help : `help`
Lists useful information such as the commands available.

==== The Command
Format: `help`

=== Adding a Person: `add`
Adds a contact to the address book.

==== The Command
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [b/BIRTHDAY] [f/FACEBOOK] [t/TAG]...`

`add` is the command word, and the other `fields` (e.g. n/NAME) are details of the contact to be added.

Appropriate `prefixes`, e.g. `n/`, `p/`, are required before typing in the required field.

After entering the command, the application will also respond with the details of the added contact, for your reference.
Refer to `section 3.2.3` below for recommended actions if contact was added with errors.

[TIP]
Optional parameters are in square brackets, such as Birthday, Facebook and Tag. These do not need to be specified when first adding a contact.

[TIP]
Contacts can have any number of tags, including zero.

[TIP]
The order of parameters entered does not matter. However, the command word `add` must be in front.

[WARNING]
Prefixes are necessary before the corresponding fields, e.g. **n/** John will work, but just entering John will not.

==== Usage Examples

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John Street, block 123, #01-01` +
Adds a contact named John Doe, with phone number: 98765432, email address: johnd@example.com, and address: John Street, block 123, #01-01.

==== Contact Added With Error
If a contact was added in error, or with errors, user can `undo`, `edit`, or `delete` it. +

* To undo, enter `undo` (recommended). +

* To edit, refer to `section 3.4` below (recommended for experienced users). +

* To delete, refer to `section 3.8` below (least recommended). +

==== Common Problems

1. Missing required fields +
Compulsory fields to be entered are
`*_name, address, phone number and email address._*`

2. Missing/wrong prefixes +
The right prefixes are needed so the application can decipher the command.

3. Duplicate contacts +
If there is a duplicate contact, Contact'em will not allow the addition.

=== Listing All Contacts : `list`

Displays all contacts in the application.

[TIP]
If you are searching for particular contact(s), it is recommended to use `find` or `findtags` instead, see details at #....#

==== The Command
Format: `list`

==== Common Problems

1. No contacts in list +
Import contacts or start adding them! +

[WARNING]
If this occurred due to an accidental `clear` command, it is recommended to `undo` as soon as possible, #without closing the application as data will be permanently lost after otherwise.#

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits the information of an existing contact. +

==== The Command

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [b/BIRTHDAY] [t/TAG]...`

==== Examples

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +

* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd person to `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

[NOTE]
`INDEX` refers to the number on the contact to be edited in the displayed list.
#refer to picture below, to be added!#

[NOTE]
You can specify any number of fields (in square brackets), but naturally at least one field must be changed for it to be a valid command. Unspecified fields will be unchanged.

[WARNING]
In this version, editing of tags changes the entire list of tags to the new one, that is, the previous list of tags the person had will be completely wiped if tags are edited.
Therefore, to add tags, user must include previous tags.

[TIP]
To remove tags, simply include the field `t/`.

[TIP]
If user wishes to revert the edit, simply type in the `undo` command **without closing the app**


==== Common Problems
* Not providing the right prefix/field +
The field entered must be suitable for the prefix, for example, entering a phone number with the address field prefix `a/` will not pass.

* Old tags were unintentionally removed +
Use the `undo` command to revert changes.

* Not entering the correct `index` +
Ensure that the `index` entered is correct, or it may cause unintentional changes to another contact. +
[NOTE]
`Index` is the #currently displayed# number corresponding to the contact, which may differ if the current displayed list has been filtered.


#Feature to edit tags specifically coming in future updates!#

=== Locating persons by name: `find`
`Find` contacts whose names contain any of the given keywords. +

Returns `john` and `John Doe`.
* `find Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any person having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`.

Keywords are not case-sensitive.

[TIP]
Order of keywords does not matter.

[NOTE]
As long as a single word in a contact's name matches any of the keywords, that contact will be displayed.

[NOTE]
Only full words will be matched, for example, finding `Han` will not match `Hans`. To search for a contact without specifying the full word, refer to `EasyFind` in the section below.

// tag::EasyFind[]
==== EasyFind

The easyfind feature improves on the find feature. Contact'em now auto updates the results display whenever user inputs a letter with the `find` command word.

 Returns `Alex` and `Alexandra`

[NOTE]
Different letter sequences will be separated by a space .

[NOTE]
As long as a letter in a contact’s name matches any of the keywords, that contact will be displayed.

// end::EasyFind[]


// tag::findtags[]
=== Finding Contacts by Tag : `findtags`

image::findtags-after.png[width="200"]
_Figure 5.6.3c : Application displays all contacts tagged as friends_

The figures above demonstrate an example of how this command is used, with respect to the first example.


==== Note on Singular and Plural Keywords
To make it more convenient for you to search for contacts through their tags, this search function will attempt to be more lenient with singular and plural tenses.
For example: +

* `friend` will return contacts with either tag `friend` or `friends`. +
* `colleagues` will return contacts with either tag `colleague` or `colleagues`.

However, this will not work for words where plural and singular differs not only by a single letter 's'.
Searching by tag `family` will attempt to find contacts with tags `family` and `familyS` instead of `families`.

==== Specifying Exclusions
`SINCE V1.4`

You can now specify tags to be excluded in this command, by simply adding a dash ('-') before keywords specified for exclusion.
This feature will help you better manage your contacts.

`findtags` friends #-colleagues# +
In this case, the application will show only those who are tagged as friends, but are #NOT# tagged as colleagues.

Specifying only tags to exclude +
Example 2:
`findtags` #-colleagues# +
In this case, the application will show **all** contacts who are #NOT# tagged colleagues, regardless of other tags.

// end::findtags[]
