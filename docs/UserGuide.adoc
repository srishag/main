== Using the Application

Below are the details of commands currently available and their usage.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing Help : `help`
Lists useful information such as the commands available.

==== The Command
Format: `help`

=== Adding a Person: `add`
Adds a contact to the address book.

==== The Command
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [b/BIRTHDAY] [f/FACEBOOK] [t/TAG]...`

`add` is the command word, and the other `fields` (e.g. n/NAME) are details of the contact to be added.

Appropriate `prefixes`, e.g. `n/`, `p/`, are required before typing in the required field.

After entering the command, the application will also respond with the details of the added contact, for your reference.
Refer to `section 3.2.3` below for recommended actions if contact was added with errors.

[TIP]
Optional parameters are in square brackets, such as Birthday, Facebook and Tag. These do not need to be specified when first adding a contact.

[TIP]
Contacts can have any number of tags, including zero.

[TIP]
The order of parameters entered does not matter. However, the command word `add` must be in front.

[WARNING]
Prefixes are necessary before the corresponding fields, e.g. **n/** John will work, but just entering John will not.

==== Usage Examples

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John Street, block 123, #01-01` +
Adds a contact named John Doe, with phone number: 98765432, email address: johnd@example.com, and address: John Street, block 123, #01-01.

* `add n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Betsy road, block 456, #01-02 p/98765432 t/friend` +
Adds a contact `named Betsy Crowe`, with `phone number: 98765432`, `email address: betsycrowe@example.com`, and `address: Betsy Road, block 456, #01-02`.
Also tags contact with `friend`.

==== Contact Added With Error
If a contact was added in error, or with errors, user can `undo`, `edit`, or `delete` it. +

* To undo, enter `undo` (recommended). +

* To edit, refer to `section 3.4` below (recommended for experienced users). +

* To delete, refer to `section 3.8` below (least recommended). +

==== Common Problems

1. Missing required fields +
Compulsory fields to be entered are
`*_name, address, phone number and email address._*`

2. Missing/wrong prefixes +
The right prefixes are needed so the application can decipher the command.

3. Duplicate contacts +
If there is a duplicate contact, Contact'em will not allow the addition.

=== Listing All Contacts : `list`

Displays all contacts in the application.

[TIP]
If you are searching for particular contact(s), it is recommended to use `find` or `findtags` instead, see details at #....#

==== The Command
Format: `list`

==== Common Problems

1. No contacts in list +
Import contacts or start adding them! +

[WARNING]
If this occurred due to an accidental `clear` command, it is recommended to `undo` as soon as possible, #without closing the application as data will be permanently lost after otherwise.#

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits the information of an existing contact. +

==== The Command

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

==== Examples

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd person to `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

[NOTE]
`INDEX` refers to the number on the contact to be edited in the displayed list.
#refer to picture below, to be added!#

[NOTE]
You can specify any number of fields (in square brackets), but naturally at least one field must be changed for it to be a valid command. Unspecified fields will be unchanged.

[WARNING]
In this version, editing of tags changes the entire list of tags to the new one, that is, the previous list of tags the person had will be completely wiped if tags are edited.
Therefore, to add tags, user must include previous tags.

[TIP]
To remove tags, simply include the field `t/`.

[TIP]
If user wishes to revert the edit, simply type in the `undo` command **without closing the app**


==== Common Problems
* Not providing the right prefix/field +
The field entered must be suitable for the prefix, for example, entering a phone number with the address field prefix `a/` will not pass.

* Old tags were unintentionally removed +
Use the `undo` command to revert changes.

* Not entering the correct `index` +
Ensure that the `index` entered is correct, or it may cause unintentional changes to another contact. +
[NOTE]
`Index` is the #currently displayed# number corresponding to the contact, which may differ if the current displayed list has been filtered.


#Feature to edit tags specifically coming in future updates!#

=== Locating persons by name: `find`
`Find` contacts whose names contain any of the given keywords. +

==== The Command
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

==== Examples
* `find John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`.
* `find Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any person having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`.

[TIP]
Keywords are not case-sensitive.

[TIP]
Order of keywords does not matter.

[NOTE]
As long as a single word in a contact's name matches any of the keywords, that contact will be displayed.

[NOTE]
Only full words will be matched, for example, finding `Han` will not match `Hans`. To search for a contact without specifying the full word, refer to `EasyFind` in the section below.

// tag::EasyFind[]
==== EasyFind

The easyfind feature improves on the find feature. Contact'em now auto updates the results display whenever user inputs a letter with the `find` command word.
Find persons whose names contain any of the letters in the command box constantly having the user to input `enter`.

==== Examples
 * `find Alex` +
 Returns `Alex` and `Alexandra`
 * `find Alexan` +
 Returns `Alexandra`
* `find Bet Ti Jo` +
Returns any person having starting alphabets `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`

image::EasyFind example.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.5.1 : Example of usage of EasyFind feature_

[NOTE]
Letters are case-insensitive.

[NOTE]
Different letter sequences will be separated by a space .

[NOTE]
As long as a letter in a contact’s name matches any of the keywords, that contact will be displayed.

[NOTE]
When the search results displays no results , the letters will not match any contacts even when the user continues inputting new characters.

// end::EasyFind[]


// tag::findtags[]
=== Locating persons by tag name: `findtags`
`SINCE V1.2`

Finds persons who have tags matching any of the given keywords. +

==== The Command
Format: `findtags KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` +

==== Examples
* `findtags friends` +
Returns any contact tagged `friends`.

* `findtags friends colleagues schoolmates` +
Returns any person having any of the tags `friends`, `colleagues`, and/or `schoolmates`.

==== Demonstration
image::findtags-before.PNG[width="200"]
_Figure 5.6.3a : Before entering command_

image::findtags-enter-command.PNG[width="200"]
_Figure 5.6.3b : Entering command to find all contacted tagged as friends_

image::findtags-after.png[width="200"]
_Figure 5.6.3c : Application displays all contacts tagged as friends_

The figures above demonstrate an example of how this command is used.

[TIP]
You can substitute the command `findtags` with `findtag` or `ft`.

[NOTE]
The search is **not** case-sensitive.

[NOTE]
The order of the keywords does not matter.

[NOTE]
Only full words will be matched. For example, `fri` will **not** match `friends`.

[NOTE]
Contact with at least one of the specified tag keywords will be displayed.

==== Note on singular and plural tenses
The search will attempt to be more lenient with singular and plural tenses.

For example: +

* `friend` will return contacts with either tag `friend` or `friends`. +
* `colleagues` will return contacts with either tag `colleague` or `colleagues`.

However, this may not always be correct for words where plural and singular differs not only by a single letter 's'.
Searching by tag `family` will attempt to find contacts with tags `family` and `familyS` instead of `families`.

==== Specifying Exclusions
`since v1.4`

You can now specify tags to be excluded in this command, by simply adding a dash ('-') before keywords specified for exclusion.
This feature will help you better manage your contacts.

===== Usage examples of exclusions
Specifying both tags to include and tags to exclude +
Example 1:
`findtags` friends #-colleagues# +
In this case, the application will show only those who are tagged as friends, but are #NOT# tagged as colleagues.

Specifying only tags to exclude +
Example 2:
`findtags` #-colleagues# +
In this case, the application will show **all** contacts who are #NOT# tagged colleagues, regardless of other tags.
// end::findtags[]

// tag::listtags[]
=== List tags : `listtags` +
`since v1.3`

Lists all existing tags in the App +

[TIP]
Listing all tags is designed to help you choose which tags to specify when using `findtags`.

==== The Command
Format: `listtags`

// end::listtags[]


=== Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the address book. +

==== The Command
Format: `delete INDEX`

[NOTE]
`INDEX` refers to the number on the contact to be edited in the displayed list.
#refer to picture below, to be added!#

// tag::google[]
=== Google Contacts integration

Contact'em is now integrated with the ability to import/ export / sync contacts from google contacts.
Being able to access contacts from your mobile phones is the quickest way to get things done.

image::exportusage.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.14.2 : Example of usage of Export command_

Enter `sync` to have your contacts in Google Contacts updated to Contact’em. Contacts in Google Contacts takes higher precedence and when sync is used, contacts in Contact’em will be updated to the contacts in Google Contacts.
