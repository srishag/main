=== Select Command

==== Description

The select command is mostly unchanged from the original address book. However, instead of opening a Google search of the contact’s name, the browser component instead opens the Facebook URL of the contact. Do note you have to be connected to the Internet for this to work.

==== Steps To Execute And Expected Results

*Type in*: select 3 +
*Expected Result*: Check that the Browser opens up the correct page as specified in the person card, and that the selected person card changes color.
If it does not open up immediately, please give it some time, this usually happens on the first time the browser is opened. +
*Result Message*: Selected Person: 3


Also, note that since these test data are randomly generated, they will not all point to an actual Facebook Profile. If this is the case, it will point to a Facebook Search (or prompt you to log in to do the search). This is intended, as it is up to the onus of the user to maintain the correct Facebook Address.
Therefore, select 3 is used as it coincidentally points to an actual Facebook URL, correct as of time of writing.

You can also try to enter other indexes for the parameter of the Select command.
Next, you may optionally try to click on the contact, and see if the browser still opens up to the Facebook URL of the contact, although since this is a CLI-app, this step may be omitted. +
Note that if you try to click on the contacts instead of typing, the result message will NOT change.

Now, try some out of bound numbers, for example: +
*Type in*: select 100 +
*Expected Result*: No action taken as the index is out of bounds.
*Result Message*: The person index provided is invalid

*Type in*: select 0 +
*Expected Result*: No action taken as the index is out of bounds.
*Result Message*: +
Invalid command format! +
select: Selects the person identified by the index number used in the last person listing. +
Parameters: INDEX (must be a positive integer) +
Example: select 1 +

*Type in*: select -1 +
*Expected Result*: No action taken as the index is out of bounds.
*Result Message*: As above.

=== Clear Command

==== Description

This command is used to clear the data in the address book.

==== Steps To Execute And Expected Results

*Type in*: clear +
*Expected Result*: All persons and tasks are cleared. +
*Result Message*: Address book has been cleared!

*Type in*: undo +
*Expected Result*: The person list and task list is restored to its previous form. +
*Result Message*: Undo success!

=== List All Tags Command

==== Description
The command for listing all the tags in the application is listtags. Alternatively, try lt as well, which is the shortcut alias. Note that only tags which are currently attached to at least one contact is shown.

==== Steps To Execute And Expected Results

*Type in*: listtags +
and/or +
*Type in*: lt +
*Expected result*: In the result box (under the command line), it should show which tags are currently in the application, in alphabetical order. +
*Result Message*: You have the following tags: [classmates] [colleagues] [family] [friends] [neighbours] [schoolmates]

To further test the functionality, try: +
*Type in*: add n/William Johnson p/91111111 e/william@johnson.com a/ 123 William Street #12-34 b/10101995 t/uniquetag +
*Type in*: listtags +

*Result Message*: You have the following tags: [classmates] [colleagues] [family] [friends] [neighbours] [schoolmates] [uniquetag]

Next,
*Type in*: undo or delete [Index of above contact] +
*Type in*: listtags +

*Result Message*: You have the following tags: [classmates] [colleagues] [family] [friends] [neighbours] [schoolmates]

Note that this command cannot be reversed by the undo command.

=== Finding Contacts by Tags

==== Description

The command keyword for this feature is findtags, findtag, or ft.

==== Steps To Execute And Expected Results

Try the following command: +
*Type in*: findtags friends +
*Expected result*: This should display all contacts that have the friends (or friend) tag. Should also show, in the result box, the number of contacts being displayed. +
*Result Message*: 14 persons listed!

Now, try the singular form of the word. +
*Type in*: findtags friend +
*Expected result*: The results should be the same as above, as the application searches for both singular and plural form of the word. +
*Result Message*: 14 persons listed!

Note that this is done by adding the letter ‘S’ or removing the letter ‘S’ from the keyword, so if you try **findtags family** it will attempt to find familys as well instead of family. This is a known limitation of the enhancement,
 but it is still implemented this way to reduce complexity and performance impact while bringing about some quality-of-life improvement for the user.

Next, test the exclusion, as follows: (note the dash ‘-‘ before colleagues) +
*Type in*: findtags friends -colleagues +
*Expected result*: Only friends that do not have the colleague tag are shown. +
*Result Message*: 9 persons listed!


Finally, try: (note the dash ‘-‘ before friends). +
*Type in*: findtags -friends +
*Expected result*: All contacts in the application, except those with the friends tags, are shown. +
*Result Message*: 6 persons listed!

Note that this command cannot be reversed by the undo command.
